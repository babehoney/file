Scorm Test Environment
----------------------

Say you have a bunch of SCORM packages which are zip files and you regularly need to test them but don't want to have to put them into your LMS. You might need to try them using a Scorm 1.2 or a Scorm 2004 runtime, or both.

This utilty scans the current folder for zip files and extracts them. It looks inside each folder for an imsmanifest.xml file. It looks inside that file to find the course homepage and gives you links to this file using a scorm runtime wrapper link for both 1.2 and 2004.

The scorm data model is based on Moodle 2.6(ish, with hax) and has buttons to simulate unloading and loading (without refreshing the page).

The scorm debugger for 2004 is Claude Ostyn's handy all-in-one debugger (Â© 2007 Ostyn Consulting, www.ostyn.com/standards/scorm/samples/scorm2004testwrap.htm) 

API calls are logged to the console for Scorm 1.2, whereas the Scorm2004 wrapper has a logger built in.

##Setup

Put this in a folder that your web server can write to (as it extracts files)
